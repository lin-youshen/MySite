</div>

Research on obstacle avoidance flight of UAVs in dynamic environments. A consistent method has been developed to distinguish between dynamic and static point clouds, which quickly obtains object estimation speeds through adjacent point cloud frames. At the same time, an active perception trajectory planning method is proposed for UAVs with limited perception field of view. n addition, based on the open-source pedestrian motion library [pedsim_ros](https://github.com/srl-freiburg/pedsim_ros) mapping in the [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org) to simulate the motion effects of real pedestrians.
